# Chp 1 - Psychopathology of Everyday Things

Welcome to the discussion - before opening the floor, I’d like to ask you all some questions related to the text

## Doors

> Open the floor about the doors? Think about how doors look, through a historic lens and modern lens. Google or draw some doors for reference.
Let’s design a door together. How would it look? How would it operate? Are there new ideas we can add or remove? Which choices improve or perhaps hinder the user experience.  

How could we improve a door? Door of the future and present. [Door Examples](#door)

## Discovery and Understanding : User vs Designer
The major talking points about the reading was about **discovery and understanding**. This can create a large divide, or a gulf we could call it, between the perspective and mentality of users/consumers and designers. 

### Question : Think for a moment in the previous week or weekend, have you experienced any examples of confusing objects or bad designs? 

*Pick some of these examples to take a moment to discuss simple fixes, or student approaches to redesign.*

For Ex.
> Perhaps think of the iMac computers or perhaps the mac devices you’ve used at school? Many of you are more familiar with PC devices, how many of you have had troubles turning on the Mac computers on campus? Maybe confused with how a mouse works? How would you redesign to prevent these user issues? Do you have to sacrifice seamless design for easy discovery?

For Ex2.
> A couple of weeks back I went out to a restaurant that had a restroom with a nice washroom. Always appreciative of how nice they can be, I approach the sink to wash my hands. Quickly I struggle to get the water working. Confused, I begin to observe from my perspective for any indicators that may clarify my confusion or give me guidance/reference of what to do. Sadly I couldn't obtain any reassurance of proper instruction from my observation. In a bit of frantic confusion, I began to wave my hands up and around the sink. Slowly hitting, what appeared to be a button, which in return had water come out quickly. Thinking I've come to my conclusion, I realized that there is a tiny motion sensor that is placed to the back of the sink under the faucet. Sadly, the length and design of the faucet obscured the motion sensor range which was the root of my issue with proper operation. Was this my fault or that of the designer? What is expected of a sink? What indicators are common with sinks? How have sinks evolved and why am I getting confused about how to use them?

## Affordance and Signifiers 
Would anyone like to provide a general definition of **Affordances and Signifiers** in the context of the book? Perhapes relate the definition to a realworld object? 

**Affordance**

Don Norman - 
> “An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.” (12)

Affordances - think about what actions are possible with an object yet you have to consider what understanding does the user have on how to use that agent. Are the affordances the same between user to user? Adult to child? Person to an animal?

(This video covers a good concept of affordances)[https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances?srsltid=AfmBOorAPUmc0NCsXcj_b8wcKnp8x6pg3sj6qlez_31agDs-RhmvrJp6] 

### Tyler's Chair

> Thinking about Affordance in objects reminds me of another personal encounter with a chair. You'll notice the chair has a little slit on the side of the arm. What do you propose that is for? What is tha main purpose proposed by the designer, any thoughts?

<img src="images/DOET/chp1/affordance1.png" width=50%></img>

In the chapter Don Normand talks about the conceptual models of objects. There is a **designer's** conceptual model, a **user's** conceptual model, and finally a **system image** that is provided to the user from the designer in hope's it *communicates* the intended use case of the product. 

<img src="/images/DOET/chp1/conceputalModel.png" width=50%></img>

This all goes back to perspective on how designer's approach design problems, expecting the perfect user use case, but sometimes those design solutions may not be apparent to the user's perception. The system image, which isn't included with Tyler's chair, is supposed to relay this. Yet if the instructions or idea proves challenging or confusing for the user, then there is something wrong with the design. 

>Going back to my chair you'll see that I utilize it as a holding spot for my writing materials! Again this is not the original intention of the object, but going back to the idea of "affordance" we see that the opening in the arm *affordances* a spot for my objects.

**Signifiers**

Don Norman - 
> “Good design requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is the role of the signifier.” (14)

Signifier - Derived from semiotics (i.e., the study of signs and symbols), linguistics or film, you may have come across signifiers before. A signifier is something that points to or indicates something else. 

(This video covers a good concept of signifiers)[https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/signifiers?srsltid=AfmBOoqtg-j4n4Utnes-PhU0F_yuPHb8cu-ysljtreLGwrqKlQcTnWfS]

<img src="/images/DOET/chp1/signifier.png" width=50%></img>

**Perceived Affordances**

Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.

## Mapping and Feedback 

These two concepts, Mapping and Feedback, align hand and hand with affordance and signifiers. 

> Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them. (21)

This concept reminds me of that of a video game control. Consider the mapping of the controls. The d-pad for movement and the buttons with symbols and colors normally align with in-game actions/interactions. Think for a moment about classic video games, this concept of mapping and movement aligns with the history of the video game DOOM and how impactful that was not only to the FPS genre, but also the control schema using a mouse, which wasn't the standard for FPS controls. (First it was the just arrow keys). 

<img src="/images/DOET/chp1/goodMapping.png" width=50%></img>

> Feedback—communicating the results of an action—is a wellknown concept from the science of control and information theory... Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up, going off to do other activities. This is annoying to the people, but it can also be wasteful of resources when the system spends considerable time and effort to satisfy the request, only to find that the intended recipient is no longer there. Feedback must also be informative. (21)

Feedback is equally as important. Think about games once more or something as common as exploring a digital interface. If you click a button or perform an action on a site, you expect some feedback. If nothing happens when you press the "jump" button on your controller and don't see the character jump, this feedback alludes that something is wrong. Could it be the controls/keybinds themselves? Or perhaps the controller has some type of issue. Going to the website example, not seeing the web page update, or the button replicating a pressed impression or a prevalent "loading" icon makes us unsure if the action went through. This is where clear feedback communicates this to the user. The feedback can be as complex as a video game character responding to your actions, or a single light flickering on your digital devices. 

## How do designers resolve this?

Perspective and Conceptual Model between **Designer** vs **User** vs **System Expectation**

<img src="/images/DOET/chp1/conceptualModel" width=50%></img>

Thinking back to the examples from the book, Norman talks about his fridgerator having what he thought was good mapping of the controls which upon further research showed a false conceptual model that caused confusion for the user.

## Human Centered Design (HCD)

Norman brings up the solution of Human Centered Design (HCD) that aims to help designers resolve these design problems. How can we effectively design for what can go wrong, rather than what can go right? How can designers effectively communicate controls, interfaces, and usage with proper mapping and feedback? How can objects be designed to signify proper affordances and signifiers to support user's interpretations? The main method Norman highlights is through actual user testing, iterative design approaches. This becomes a bit challenging in the grand scheme of product design when consider the many groups that are in play from manufacturing, pricing, materials, etc. Norman will continue to flesh strategies further in the text.

## Breakout Assignment

In small groups of 3, you'll be assigned the following (*avoid examples from the text*):

Group A: Find an example of poor affordances/signifiers. Consider how you can improve the affordances/signifiers? 

Group B: Breakdown the difference between Good/bad mapping or feedback. What works effectively? Any examples? (Consider "contraints" as well)

Group C: Compare digital vs physical product design counterpart (ie. a watch). Which is more effective in affordance/signifiers/mapping/feedback. 

Group D: Redesign a confusing object, either discussed today or in the text (*no doors plz*) using Norman’s principles of Affordance/Signifiers and Mapping/Feedback. 

## Final Thoughts?

Any final thoughts anyone would like to share?

> I thought it was interesting the way Norman broke down the concepts of affordance and signifiers and realigned these terms to design practices of good mapping and feedback. These principles help describe the relationship of how we as *users* perceive and interact and how *designers* must challenge their preconceived notions to design for the error, not perfection. Makes me think of the programs I've made and exhibited in the past. 1 example is many of my First Person POV virtual projects where users are introduced to a large keyboard rather than perhaps a controller which streamlines the controls. Additionally, I've made projects where users just use their phone as a "wand" to paint with in software. How can we create interactive experiences with easily conveys what actions and understanding can affordance provide and how we convey instructions and controls as well as outcomes with signifiers? By strong mapping and feedback.
