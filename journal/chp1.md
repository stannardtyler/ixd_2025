# Chp 1 - Psyhopathology of Everyday Things

Welcome to the discussion - before opening the floor, I’d like to ask you all some questions related to the text
Doors

Open the floor about the doors? Think about how doors look, through a historic lens and modern lens. Google or draw some doors for reference.
Let’s design a door together. How would it look? How would it operate? Are there new ideas we can add or remove? Which choices improve or perhaps hinder the user experience.  

## Discovery and Understanding : User vs Designer
The major talking points about the reading was about **discovery and understanding**. This can create a large divide, or a gulf we could call it, between the perspective and mentality of users/consumers and designers. 

### Question : Think for a moment in the previous week or weekend, have you experienced any examples of confusing objects or bad designs? 

*Pick some of these examples to take a moment to discuss simple fixes, or student approaches to redesign.*

For Ex.
> Perhaps think of the iMac computers or perhaps the mac devices you’ve used at school? Many of you are more familiar with PC devices, how many of you have had troubles turning on the Mac computers on campus? Maybe confused with how a mouse works? How would you redesign to prevent these user issues? Do you have to sacrifice seamless design for easy discovery?

## Affordance and Signifiers 
Would anyone like to provide a general definition of **Affordances and Signifiers** in the context of the book? Perhapes relate the definition to a realworld object? 

##Affordance##
Don Norman - 
> “An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.”

Affordances - think about what actions are possible with an object yet you have to consider what understanding does the user have on how to use that agent. Are the affordances the same between user to user? Adult to child? Person to an animal?

(This video covers a good concept of affordances)[https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances?srsltid=AfmBOorAPUmc0NCsXcj_b8wcKnp8x6pg3sj6qlez_31agDs-RhmvrJp6] 

##Signifiers##
Don Norman - 
> “Good design requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is the role of the signifier.”

Signifier - Derived from semiotics (i.e., the study of signs and symbols), linguistics or film, you may have come across signifiers before. A signifier is something that points to or indicates something else.
