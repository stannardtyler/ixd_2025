# Journal Entry 01

  Currenty progressing my way through the course, beginning to explore interaction design concepts from the Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman, as well as further dive deeper into Javascript programming. Focusing on readability and mapping has created a new perspective in my projects. Next week we'll review concepts of vanilla javascript as they call it by reading the first chapter of Eloquent Javascript.

Here is a quick sketch that features both base P5js and Vanilla Javascript. [P5js Editor Link](https://editor.p5js.org/tstannard64/sketches/ajbCb59o7)
Wish me luck!
